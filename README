Fastgps licensing summary
13 August 2008

The ideas and behind this receiver come from many sources. The basic concepts of
GPS receivers are well-explained both in the GPS ICD and in numerous excellent
technical textbooks. 

Because some parts of the implementation of this receiver were (very) loosely
derived from other GPL-licensed software receivers, we have chosen to license
those portions of the receiver under the GPL so as to avoid any confusion. The
parts of the receiver which we have implemented ourselves without any
contributions whatsoever from GPL code are licensed under the BSD license. This
distinction is preserved at the file level, and each file will have either a
BSD header on it or a GPL header. The full text of the GPL license (v2) is
copied in the GPL file in this directory. The BSD license is much shorter; it
is reproduced in its entirety at the top of those files to which it applies.

Note that this mixture of GPL and BSD code means that the resulting executable
is licensed under the GPL, and that any changes to the GPL-licensed files must
comply with the terms of the GPL (namely, all changes must be publicly
distrubted; closed-source, proprietary derivatives are not allowed by the GPL).
